# CompilerConstruction

## Compiling and Running Tests

Run `make clean` to remove any junk first.
Run `make` in the terminal to compile all the necessary files.

Run the script called `runtest`, which can be found in the `test` folder. You may need to run `chmod 755 ./runtest` if you are not permitted to run the script.
